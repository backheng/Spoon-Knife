If you’re working through this lesson on your own, you can carry on by opening a second terminal window. 

This window will represent your partner, working on another computer. You won’t need to give anyone access on GitHub,

The Owner needs to give the Collaborator access. On GitHub, click the settings button on the right, 

then select Collaborators, and enter your partner’s username.
